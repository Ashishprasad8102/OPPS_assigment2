    "2>Abstraction and encapsulation are two important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) that serve \n",

    "\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    "- Abstraction focuses on representing complex real-world entities as simplified models in code.\n",
    "- It involves identifying the essential features, behaviors, and characteristics of an object while hiding\n",
    "the unnecessary details.\n",
    "- Abstraction helps in creating modular code by breaking down a system into smaller, self-contained components.\n",
    "- It allows us to define interfaces and behaviors without exposing the internal implementation.\n",

    "- It helps in managing complexity and making code more maintainable and scalable.\n",

    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "- Encapsulation is about bundling data and methods (or functions) that operate on that data into a single\n",
    "unit, called a class.\n",
    "- It involves combining data and the operations on that data into a single entity.\n",
    "- Encapsulation provides data hiding, as the internal state of an object is not directly accessible from outside.\n",
    "- It allows the class to have control over how the data is accessed and modified by using access modifiers \n",
    "(e.g., public, private, protected).\n",
    "- Encapsulation provides encapsulated objects that can be treated as black boxes, with only their public\n",

    "4In Python, data abstraction can be achieved through the use of classes and objects. Here are\n",
    "the steps to achieve data abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a class: Create a class that represents the abstract data type you want to define.\n",
    "The class should encapsulate the data and operations related to that data. The details of the \n",
    "internal implementation should be hidden from the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Determine the public interface: Identify the essential methods and attributes that external code should\n",
    "be able to access. These methods and attributes define the public interface of the class. They should\n",
    "provide the necessary functionality without exposing the internal workings of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use access modifiers: In Python, there are conventions for indicating the accessibility of class members.\n",
    "By default, all attributes and methods in a class are public, meaning they can be accessed from outside the\n",
    "class. To achieve data abstraction, you can use access modifiers like `_` (single underscore) or `__` \n",
    "(double underscore) to indicate that an attribute or method is intended to be private or protected.\n",
    "Private attributes and methods should not be accessed or modified directly from outside the class,\n",
    "allowing you to control access to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Implement methods and attributes: Define the methods and attributes within the class to provide the\n",
    "desired functionality. These methods can perform operations on the encapsulated data or provide information\n",
    "about the object's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Interact with objects: Create instances (objects) of the class and interact with them using the public\n",
    "interface provided by the class. External code should only use the public methods and attributes to perform \n",
    "operations on the objects. The internal implementation details of the class should be hidden from the \n",
    "outside world, maintaining data abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example demonstrating data abstraction in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):\n",
    "        self._account_number = account_number\n",
    "        self._balance = balance\n",
    "\n",
    "    def deposit(self, amount):\n",
    "        self._balance += amount\n",
    "\n",
    "    def withdraw(self, amount):\n",
    "        if amount <= self._balance:\n",
    "            self._balance -= amount\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"Insufficient balance.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_balance(self):\n",
    "        return self._balance\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an instance of the BankAccount class\n",
    "account = BankAccount(\"1234567890\", 1000)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Interact with the object using the public interface\n",
    "account.deposit(500)\n",
    "account.withdraw(200)\n",
    "print(account.get_balance())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `BankAccount` class encapsulates the account number and balance. The `deposit()`,\n",
    "`withdraw()`, and `get_balance()` methods provide the public interface for interacting with the account. \n",
    "The internal implementation details of the class (e.g., the attributes `_account_number` and `_balance`)\n",
    "are hidden from the external code, achieving data abstraction."
